### Personal rules for the challenge

    Thats my personal rules to the challenge (not official):
    
    Step 1: as-is: do the project as conceived by your creator.
    Step 2: heavy comment: Bring in one fork, all possible notes about code structure and gotchas learned.
    step 3: refactor: refactor the code with known best-practices and code structures.
    step 4: Enhancement: Attempts to improve the first-proposal of the article.

`Current Status: step 1`

_**Note** Some code structure has already changed._
